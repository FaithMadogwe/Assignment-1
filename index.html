<H1>MY FAVORITE MOVIES</H1>
<ol>
    <li>Breadth of life. I love how the fact that the main character was able to reconcile with god before dying, he gave up his life for his house help and also willed is multi million properties for him
               <p>Also the suspense in the movies was worth it, the emotions the quality. infact i will say the producer, the director, and the entire cast and crew members outdid themselves.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Far from home. This movie is a great one, the high school scenes, the morals, the actors and actress are good roles.
         <p>I also love the message and the fact that the main character was able to clean up his mess.</p></li>
    <li>Miracle in cell. Though anoying from the begining but but i ended up crying like a child, i love, the main character who had some disabilities and can be easily passed as a mad person was still very much and actively present in his childs life. <p> I feel its a great lesson to every fathers, that they have no excuse to be absent in their kids life</p></li>
    <li>A tribe called judea. This movie is quite interesting, even though i have many questions for mama ejiro, she needs to explain how she got pregnant for different men <p>Also the fact that it ended on a happy note despite the fact that one has to pay the price of dying.</p></li>
    <li>Queen of the south. This tops the list, how a little helpless girl in the street of mexico was able to survive the street of mexico. <p>she did not only survive the street but also became a very powerful drug lord, then quite and leave happily with the people she loves.</p></li>
